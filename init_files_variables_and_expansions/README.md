**init_files_variables_and_expansions

This folder contains shell scripts designed to practice initialization files, shell variables, and command-line expansions. The exercises will help you understand how to manage environment and local variables, perform arithmetic operations, and use expansions for flexible scripting in the Unix/Linux shell.
